        <p class="ital">A generative art application built in Processing</p>
        <p>
          Whirligrid takes as input a source image and an array of colors. When
          run, the app arranges a defined number of the source images on a grid
          while at the same time transforming the size, rotation and opacity of
          those images.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source images I use are created mainly in Illustrator. I use
          various methods for generating the colorways ... sometimes pulled from
          Adobe Color, other times extracted from an existing static image of my
          own.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice the app has to be run 15 or so times before generating a
          keeper. Once an image is generated it's taken into Illustrator for
          cleanup and for exploring the assignment of the colors in differeent
          and random distributions across the layout. From there it goes into
          Lightroom to further explore and perfect the colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this version of the app has been built in Processing, I'm
          currently working to rebuild the app in p5.js in order to release it
          as a web app for others to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further out I'll animate these images and to use those realtime
          animations in live events that I VJ.

            State of Awareness was constructed while reflecting on time I spent
            with my mother who passed a few years ago. The piece was constructed
            in a welcome state of reverie.

            Using the same source image as in State of Awareness, I constructed
            these pieces in the autumn of 2021 while living in Sacramento. The
            trees are a huge amenity for the city, and they absolutely shine
            each fall.

          <p>
            I've begun printing these designs as laptop decals soon to be
            followed with fine art prints big and small.
