        <h2>Daylies, 1994-Present</h2>
        <p>
          I picked up a camera in 1994, and was immediately enamored. As my very
          first print was taking shape in the developer tray, a guy next to me
          took a look and and reacted to it in the same way I had myself. He got
          the joke! Being painfully shy back then this opened up the door to an
          alternate means of communication. I could tell jokes without even
          moving my lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied photography at Parsons School of Design. And I still shoot
          every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work below focuses on formal elements of art: line, shape, space,
          color and texture. That in mind it's not a surprise that I'm attracted
          to Modernism. I do work in a number of loosely coupled mediums, but
          this collection of images ties directly to the foundation upon which
          most of what I do is built.
